Erin,NONE,neutralB,characterB,"Oh, hello there. You look quite lost, and I do assure you, this isn't the kind of place you want to be lost in."
Narrator,neutralA,NONE,characterA,"The bird seems to be speaking to you. You don't know why, but there is something familiar about it."
Narrator,neutralA,NONE,characterA,"He cocks his head, beady eyes trained on you with something resembling pity. At least, you think it's pity. Birds don't usually look at people with pity."
Erin,NONE,neutralB,characterB,"My name is Erin. Some call me a guide, and other call me an... inconvenience, at best."
Erin,NONE,neutralB,characterB,"Ah, but I digress. Your path must have been difficult, if you have found yourself here at the seeming end of it."
Erin,NONE,neutralB,characterB,"However, now is not the time to be morose. Your time is short, and you must leave this place with haste."
Erin,NONE,neutralB,characterB,"Stay here too long, and you might forget how to leave. Unless that is your intention?"
Narrator,neutralA,NONE,characterA,"You aren't exactly sure what they mean, but you sense a rare sincerity behind their words. Did you want to be here?"
Erin,NONE,neutralB,characterB,"You'll meet some that would have you stay here forever, and I imagine that they might be somewhat... forceful, in keeping you put."
Erin,NONE,neutralB,characterB,"You stand at the entrance of Snow White's domain. A kind soul, on most occasions. Too kind, perhaps. Her benevolence has become a bit... twisted, as of late."
Erin,NONE,neutralB,characterB,"I imagine she thinks keeping you here is for the best. You'll probably have to convince her otherwise, but it won't be easy."
Erin,NONE,neutralB,characterB,"Here, it's dangerous to go alone, and defenseless, take your pick."
